# poshowtubelite

A stripped down PoShowTube - https://www.poshowtube.com/home.php - the easy way to make dynamic YouTube audio videos unique for your song. Over 50 configurable processing graphics routines to help you make YouTube videos in minutes.

This project contains example code to setup an environment for running processing 3 sketches https://processing.org/reference/  in eclipse with a JavaFX window to use for controlling the sketch.

Versions:
- Processing 3
- Eclipse Version: 2019-12 (4.14.0)
- Java jdk1.8.0_241
- (optional) JavaFx Scene Builder 1.1 - helps for control layout

Note: java 8 is the last java to self contain javaFX, right now processing 3 would probably need Java 8 and this JavaFX code definately would.  If you wanted to move to Java 11,12,13... etc you would need to see if processing 4+ exists and load javaFX seperately.

It also shows how you can load and record graphics against a song.
